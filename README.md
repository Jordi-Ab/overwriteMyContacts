# overwriteMyContacts
This little piece of code helped me append the "+52 1" Mexican international prefix at the beginning of all my Mexican contact cellphones.

When I first created my contacts list I was living at mexico, and there was 
no need to add the mexican international prefix to the contacts.
Then I moved out from Mexico, and when getting an international number, whatsapp was
not identifying my contacts because they were lacking the international prefix.
So instead of going one by one adding the prefix, this little piece of code made
that happen for me.
